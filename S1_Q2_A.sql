-- Query: Daily Recovery Rate with 3-Week Moving Average
-- Purpose:
--   1. Clean and normalize raw loan data (balances & repayments).
--   2. Aggregate daily total repayments and outstanding balances.
--   3. Compute daily recovery rate (%) per day.
--   4. Calculate 21-day moving average of recovery rate (~3 weeks).
